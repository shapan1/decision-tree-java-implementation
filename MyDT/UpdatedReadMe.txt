Task 11 Decision Tree C4.5 Algorithm Implementation version 3.2 4/9/2016

Description Notes
--------------------

- TASK A:
	Out of the selected products, the main goal of the Algorithm is to show the precise recomendation of the product to the customer based on         the Attributes or features such the type of the customer.(For e.g. : Student, Professor, Doctor etc)

- TASK B:
	Using the Algorithm we can further anticipate the success of a particular product in term if the calculated accuracy.

- This Algorithm has been implemented in java.

- The Program is run using the "Tester.java" file.(You can do it using an IDE or go to command prompt->
	1. open cmd
	2. go to src directory location
	3. Place the input files for task A and files respectively for task B 
	4. Compile the program and when Running it please provide exactly two arguments, the first being the training data and the second being            the testing data. 
	5. Finally the program will terminate and will show two new files created one for Cross Validation and other to represent the result test 	labeled data.)
- Please note that the result files MUST be opened in a different text editor than notepad such as sublime text, notepad++, brackets etc, to see     the result data in the formated view.
- The result files will be created in the same directory as the input files as .txt files.
- when Using IDE such as Eclipse To RUN:
	1. open Tester file.
	2. go to Run Configurations -> arguments The first argument should be the training data and the second should be the testing data.
	3. put the path of the input files over there separated by a single space.
	4. Run the program to get the desired output.(The output file will be generated in the same folder. Also the result file should opened in             a different text editor than notepad.)
P.S. : the input files has been added to the MyDt folder.
